            h6 History
            p
              | The Store Decor Company was founded in 1983 by Robert Potts in Rowlett, Texas, as a 
              | compliment to his already successful store planning company, Robert Potts & Associates, which 
              | works with independent hardware and drug retailers across the nation. Bob began his store-planning 
              | career in 1954 as a remodeling specialist at a wholesale drug company. He quickly realized the 
              | importance of adding interior signage and decor to help guide customers to various departments within 
              | a store. The decor items Bob conceived and produced set him apart from others in his industry, and 
              | set his clients apart from their competitors. These ideas and concepts are still the driving force behind 
              | The Store Decor Company today. From humble beginnings, which included one small building and two employees, 
              | Store Decor has grown to utilize 14 buildings at 120,000 square feet, over 100 team members, state of the 
              | art equipment and a creative work environment to continuously establish the standard for fabulous retail 
              | experiences. At Store Decor, our mission is to create an exciting and effective trade environment for our 
              | client that enables the sale of more products and motivates the consumer to repeatedly visit.
            p#aboutHeader Meet The Founder
            img(src="../../../assets/images/about_page/bob_founder_and_owner.jpg")
            p
              | <span class="inlineTitle">Robert Potts</span> began his career with a wholesale drug company, McKesson & Robbins of Dallas, TX in 1954. 
              | His position was that of a remodeling specialist to McKesson’s customers. He was to sell drug store owners, 
              | and to other businesses if he could, on the benefits of remodeling and/or creating new stores. He was paid 
              | a commission on the sale of store fixtures to these customers.  
            p
              | During the late 50’s and early 60’s, Bob developed a decor expertise that aided him in selling store 
              | fixtures to new or remodeled stores. The decor he designed and sold set him apart from his competitors. 
              | He established his own firm, Robert Potts & Associates, and developed many steady customers. His firm had 
              | something no other store fixture firm had, and the customers wanted more. 
            br
            h6 Hardware and Decor
            p
              | The first hardware retailer in the United States to use Bob’s decor ideas was Elliott’s Hardware of Dallas, TX. 
              | Mr. Jerre Elliott allowed Bob to design and install the newest, most outstanding decor ever seen in a self-service 
              | store of any type in the nation. Elliott’s Hardware, a member of the nationally known True Value Hardware cooperative, 
              | opened in 1971 and gained national and international attention. The store was extremely successful because of Elliott’s 
              | expertise and Bob’s decor. It could be said that Elliott’s pioneered the use of greeters at the front door, self-service 
              | displays on all hardware items, and excellent interior decor. This set them apart from most hardware stores in America.
            p
              | Lumberyards, gift shops, book stores, pet stores, and even clothing stores, after seeing Elliott’s Hardware, became 
              | clients of Potts & Associates. The Foxworth-Galbraith Lumber Company—at the time having 54 retail locations in Texas, 
              | New Mexico, Arizona, and California—asked Bob to assist them in the design, fixture installation, merchandising and 
              | decorating of their new Building Materials Centers.  They also requested that he develop a merchandising training program 
              | and conduct seminars for their employees. Eventually, Bob further developed this training program and began providing it 
              | for numerous retailers and lumber/hardware associations in many states. The importance of effective decor within a retail 
              | establishment was stressed and incorporated during seminar sessions.
            p 
              | Decor items such as plaques, symbols, letters and stripes had to be manufactured by Bob himself. He would rent or 
              | borrow a hot-wire cutter from a florist to cut letters out of styrofoam. Business demands grew, and soon, the decor 
              | manufacturing phase moved to its own building in Rowlett, TX, and became the offshoot retail graphics firm—The Store 
              | Decor Company. Bob’s eight sales associates kept his young company busy constructing decor for the stores they designed 
              | or remodeled. In the early 80’s, computerized vinyl cutting machines were invented and Bob purchased several of them. 
              | This added exciting, new capabilities for the company; they could now supply hundreds of interior signs for their retail 
              | customers in much less time. With the purchase of a computerized CNC router, it became possible to cut letters, stripes 
              | and symbols from any kind of material. Employees no longer had to cut by hand.
            br
            h6 Category Evolution
            p
              | Potts & Associates received numerous awards and recognition for its fabulously designed stores in every market of the nation. 
              | The use of its own firm, Store Decor, was key to its success. Then, along came the “category killer”, a type of retailer 
              | that specialized in and focused on a specific category of consumer products with increased buying, selling, merchandising and 
              | advertising. Companies like BizMart, PetStuff, Petco, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Staples, PetSmart, Men’s Warehouse, The Container 
              | Store, PayLess Shoe Stores, Zainy Brainy and Lil‘ Things all opened hundreds of stores across the United States. These companies 
              | relied on effective decor to convince their customers that they had the greatest selection at the lowest price. They focused on 
              | guiding customers through the store in a way that would increase sales because of impulse purchases. Brilliant colors, great designs, 
              | and impactful images improved the customers’ opinion of the store. The consolidation of the companies‘ purchasing power from 
              | manufacturers increased their gross margins tremendously. Hundreds of joint venture financing firms made these companies work; then 
              | they took their stock public for grander rewards.  
            p
              | Store Decor was one of only a few firms that specialized in helping these stores accomplish their goals. Their main competitors 
              | were exterior sign companies, which were hardly competition at all since they lacked the necessary decor expertise. Store Decor 
              | worked with hundreds of these retailers via Potts & Associates and was greatly rewarded with increased volume and profits.
            br

            h6.wrap-img A picture is worth a thousand words
            p
              | The influx of international individuals to the country provided an opportunity for retailers to enjoy tremendous sales to new citizens. 
              | Bob calculated that, through the use of visuals such as sculpted objects or flat cutouts of products, he could enhance the shopping experience 
              | and avoid the necessity for a customer to be fluent in the English language. Sculptors who had experience carving styrofoam were added to Bob’s 
              | team. Large items—like vegetables & fruits for grocery stores, or hammers & saws for hardware stores—were carved, painted and installed in stores 
              | all across the United States. Employing these visual graphics with great success were retailers such as Elliott’s Hardware, Sears Hardware, 
              | Sears/Orchard Supply Hardware and other numerous building materials centers.
            p
              | Architectural firms soon discovered that Store Decor could produce architectural elements. The architects wanted elements for exterior 
              | use where stone sculptures proved to be sometimes cost prohibitive. Since styrofoam deteriorates when exposed to the weather, Bob and 
              | his team needed a way to protect it. They found a polyurethane chemical mixture which was used for coating pipeline interiors to prevent 
              | them from leaking. After many attempts, they were successful in coating styrofoam sculptures with this material, making the foam impervious 
              | to weather. Numerous projects were completed and installed all over the United States and beyond. Store Decor has sculptures facing the 
              | Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, a large project in Saudi Arabia, and also an ornate facade on the main building of Lone Star Park horse 
              | racing track in Grand Prairie, TX. Store Decor’s incredible versatility is showcased on many McDonald’s restaurants in Texas and other states. 
              | On the restaurant near the Dallas Zoo, carved cartoon animals provide a wonderful gateway to the zoo and have helped to make this landmark 
              | McDonald's a whopping success. Another outstanding example is located on Montfort @ I-635 and includes giant hamburgers, french fries, and 
              | a larger than life Ronald McDonald.

              | In January of 1996, Bob and his key employees traveled to 3M in St. Paul, MN to research electrostatic wide format printers. Bob felt that, 
              | since the best product merchandising was visual, what better way to show your product to potential buyers than with a large, vibrant picture! 
              | His company purchased its first Scotchprint in 1996 and an additional machine in 2000. Bob and his staff continue to search out other types 
              | of printers to help expand their visual graphics department. Since his initial printer purchase, several machines have been retired and replaced 
              | to keep Store Decor at the forefront of printing, cutting and print finishing. Examples of that can be seen in every store for which Store Decor 
              | designs or manufactures.

              | The equipment evolution continues as Bob strives to provide better service and superior products. It all began by the Grace of God and a 
              | desire to make things better.
