            h6 Robert P. Potts – Store Decor Founder and Owner
            p
              | Robert Potts began his career with a wholesale drug company, McKesson & Robbins of Dallas, TX in 1954. 
              | His position was that of a remodeling specialist to McKesson’s customers. He was to sell drug store 
              | owners, and others if he could, on the benefits of remodeling and/or creating new stores. He was paid 
              | on the basis of the amount of profit made in the sales of store fixtures to these customers.
            p
              | During the latter 50’s and 60’s Potts developed his store decor expertise to aid him in selling store 
              | fixtures to new or remodeled stores. The store decor he designed and sold set Potts apart from his competitors. 
              | After establishing his own firm; many steady customers were developed through the use of good store decor in 
              | his customer’s retail stores. The Potts firm had something no other store fixture firm had; and the customers 
              | wanted more.
            h6 Hardware and Decor
            p
              | The first hardware retailer in the U.S. to use Potts’ store decor was Elliott’s Hardware of Dallas, TX. 
              | Mr. Jerry Elliott allowed Potts to design and install the newest and most outstanding store decor ever 
              | seen in a self-service store of any type in the U.S. Elliott’s Hardware, being a member of the nationally 
              | know True Value Hardware cooperative; gained national and international attention for the outstanding 
              | store which was opened in 1971. The store was extremely successful because of Elliott’s expertise and good 
              | interior decor. It can be said that Elliott’s pioneered the use of greeters at the front door, self service 
              | displays on all hardware items and good interior decor. This set them apart from the normal hardware store 
              | in America.
            p
              | Numerous other retailers, having visited the Elliott’s Hardware, became clients of the Potts firm. Such 
              | retailers as lumberyards, gift shops, book stores, pet stores, and even clothing stores became clients. 
              | The Foxworth-Galbraith Lumber Co. with 54 retail locations in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California 
              | asked Potts to assist them in the design, fixture installation, merchandising and decorating of their new 
              | “Building Materials Centers”.  Foxworth-Galbraith also asked Potts to develop a Merchandising Training 
              | program for their employees and to conduct seminars for their employees. These seminars evolved into Potts 
              | further developed this program and provided it for numerous Retailers and Lumber /Hardware associations in 
              | many states. The importance of the use of good store decor within the retail establishment was stressed 
              | during such sessions.
            p
              | Store Decor items such as plaques, symbols, letters, stripes, and etc. had to be manufactured by Potts himself. 
              | He would rent or borrow a ‘hot wire cutter’ from a florist and then cut out the letters from Styrofoam. Eventually 
              | the manufacturing phase of store decor had to be moved to its own building in Rowlett, TX. The Potts & Associates 
              | firm’s eight sales associates kept the young company busy constructing store decor for the stores they designed or 
              | remodeled. The invention of the computerized vinyl cutting machine in the early 80’s led Potts to purchase many of 
              | these machines for his Store Decor Co. Inc. – Retail Graphics firm. These machines opened up a new and exciting field 
              | for Potts; he could now supply hundreds of interior signs for his retail customers. Later, the newly developed, 
              | computerized router was purchased making it possible to cut letters, stripes, symbols, etc. from any kind of material. 
              | Previously, the firm’s employees had to cut the letters by hand. No more, the computers were loaded with hundreds of 
              | ‘letter fonts’, symbols, shapes, and designs. 
            h6 Category Evolution
            p
              | The firm received numerous awards and recognition for its fabulously designed stores in every market of the U.S. The 
              | use of its own store decor firm was the secret to the success of the Robert P. Potts & Associates firm. Then, along 
              | came a new type of retailer known as “the category killer”. This type of retailer picked on a category of consumer 
              | products and specialized in that item with increased buying, selling, merchandising, & advertising of that category. 
              | Firms such as BizMart, PetStuff, Petco, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Staples, PetsMart, Men’s Warehouse, The Container 
              | Store, PayLess Shoe Stores, Zainy Brainy, Lil Things, all opened hundreds of stores across the U.S. They concentrated 
              | on convincing their retail customers that they had the greatest selection of product at the lowest price. To accomplish 
              | this, these retailers relied on good store decor… they had to have loads of interior signs to create the right low price 
              | impression. They had to guide the customer through the store so the customers would increase their sales with ‘impulse 
              | purchases’. The proper colors, designs, and images improved the customers’ opinion of the store; the consolidation of 
              | their purchasing power from manufacturers increased their gross margins tremendously. Hundreds of ‘Joint Venture 
              | Financing Firms’ made these category killers work… then, they took their stock public for the grand reward.
            p
              | The Store Decor Co. was one of the few U.S. firms specializing in assisting these stores to accomplish their goals. 
              | The firm’s competitors were exterior sign companies that did not have the expertise in working with retailers that 
              | the employees of Store Decor had developed through their store fixture experience with Robert P. Potts & Assocs. The 
              | firm worked with hundreds of these stores and was rewarded greatly with increased volume and profits.
            h6 One picture is worth a thousand words…
            p
              | The influx of “English as a second language” individuals to the U.S. provided an opportunity for many retailers to 
              | enjoy tremendous sales to these new citizens. Many were unable to speak or read English but Potts calculated through 
              | the use of ‘visuals’ such as sculptures or cutouts of retailer’s products; he could get around the inability of the 
              | person to read English interior signs. Potts employed sculptors with experience in carving Styrofoam. Large items such 
              | as vegetables, fruits, etc. for grocery stores; hammers, saws, tools, etc. for hardware stores were carved, painted, 
              | and installed in stores all across the U.S.; such as Elliott’s’ Hardware; Sears Hardware, Sears/Orchard Supply Hardware, 
              | and numerous building materials centers. Prescription bottles and other drug items were made for use in drug stores 
              | and pharmacies.
            p
              | Architectural firms soon discovered there was such a firm as Store Decor Co. to produce architectural sculptures. The 
              | architects wanted the sculptures for exterior use but could not pay for them to be done from stone.  That presented a 
              | problem since Styrofoam deteriorated when exposed to the weather. Potts discovered a polyurethane chemical mixture used 
              | to coat the interior of pipelines to prevent them from leaking after years of use. After numerous attempts, the firm 
              | was successful in coating Styrofoam sculptures with this material, which made the foam impervious to weather.  Numerous 
              | projects were completed and installed all over the U.S.; Store Decor has sculptures facing the Atlantic and the Pacific 
              | plus a large project in Saudi Arabia. Not to mention the face of the main building at the horse racetrack in Grand 
              | Prairie, TX. Many McDonald’s restaurants in Texas are other examples of the versatility of Store Decor Co. Carved 
              | cartoon animals provide a wonderful ‘gateway’ to the Dallas Zoo and have helped to make this new restaurant a whopping 
              | success. Another is located on Montfort @ I-635 with giant size hamburgers, French fries, and a larger than life Ronald 
              | McDonald.

            p
              | 3M Company of Minnesota was the first to make available to U.S. firms the use of a Wide Format Printer using electrostatic 
              | technology. Potts felt that since product merchandising was ‘visual’, what better way to show your product to buyers 
              | than with a large, colorful picture? January 1996 found Potts and his key employees at the 3M Plant in St. Paul, MN 
              | studying the use of such machines. The firm purchased its first Scotchprint machine for a whopping $360,000.00 in 1996 
              | and its second one for $420,000.00 in 2000. An Inkjet Printer was later purchased which will print in full color on 
              | banner material 10ft high by 160ft in length; or as long as the material is in a roll.  Robert Potts and the staff are 
              | constantly searching out other types of printers to aid in expanding their ‘visual graphics department’. The use of 
              | digital technology is a ‘God send’ to Store Decor Co. Examples of it are to be found in every store the firm designs 
              | and manufactures. Later additions to the firms list of digital printers include 3 Vutek 8 color machines and the changes 
              | keep appearing fast as Potts strives to provide a better service and product. Store Decor Co, with its 125 (plus or 
              | minus) employees, working in approximately 120,000 sq. ft., can provide all of these products from their plant at 
              | Rowlett, TX. Plus, its traveling teams of installers personally install all of the products in the client’s stores 
              | anywhere in the world.
            h6 It all began by the Grace of God and a desire to make things better.

            h6 The Dallas Morning News Ideas at Work by Cheryl Hall (edited for the web)
            h6 Sign Language: The Store Decor's graphics and sculptures point the way.
            p
              | Bob Potts watches with pride as a specialized printing machine rolls out a huge aquarium scene, inch by intensely 
              | colorful inch. When it's finished, 3-foot goldfish, angelfish and iridescent cichlids will dart through lush underwater
              | plant life on a PetsMart wall that's half the size of a football field.
            p
              | Mr. Potts plopped down more than $400,000 in cash for this machine because the pet-supply megachain wanted to create 
              | graphic banners up to 150 feet long. And when a key customer has a hankering, the owner of The Store Decor Co. does 
              | his best to satisfy it.
            p
              | "Our entire mission is to help our customers' customers buy more," says Mr. Potts, 69, who launched his business career 
              | as a Fuller Brush man.
            p
              | "It used to be the merchandise that created the excitement. Now it's the store. You have to make the shopping experience 
              | special."
            p
              | The Store Decor is one of those thriving area business that most of us have no idea exists. Its corporate domain is a series 
              | of 11 metal buildings tucked away in the industrial outskirts of Rowlett where pasture and civilization meet. The buildings - 
              | including woodworking, painting, printing and sculpture shops- line both sides of the street used mostly by concrete trucks 
              | from a neighboring mixing plant.
            p
              | Yet if you shop at Elliott's Hardware, Tom Thumb,OfficeMax or PetsMart, you've seen the company's handiwork in interior signs, 
              | large-scale graphics and funky sculptures. The Store Decor churned out 500 waist-high Saint Bernard's and smaller tabby cats used 
              | by PetsMart to collect money for its pet-charities campaign. Drivers along Interstate 30 got an eyeful a couple of years ago when 
              | a giant gorilla rumbled into downtown on a flatbed truck, headed to permanent habitat at The Tilt game room in the West end. Then 
              | there's the sculptured façade that greets horse racing fans at Lone Star Park.When you need a 10-foot angry ape head with foot-long 
              | fangs or a 6-foot horse's head worked into an elaborate filigree design, Store Decor is the place to call.
            p
              | Every month or so, a truckload of Styrofoam or Gatorfoam comes into the sculpting department, then it will be carved, shaped and 
              | sanded into creatures and food items.
            p
              | "Those are the fun things," says Mr. Potts, "but we make our money off the decor and signage."
            p
              | That's because the bulk of Store Decor's business -about 80 percent - is indoor signs that provide road map's for shopping. When San 
              | Antonio-based HEB opens its fleet of grocery stores here, Store Decor's sign will point the way in 8-foot letters to meat, milk and 
              | produce.
            p
              | Charlie Bond, president of Elliott's Hardware Inc.,says that in a multilingual world, standout graphics are increasingly important. 
              | The signs at the just-opened Elliott's in Plano are made-to-scale wrenches,bolts and screws or paint cans and brushes.
            p
              | "It's easy to recognize each department when you first walk in," he says. "Anybody can identify what it is no matter what language 
              | they speak."
            h6 Nice and Polite
            p
              | In a climate that worships youthful high flying risk Robert P. Potts presents a strong argument for vision honed by hard-taught insight. 
              | He graduated from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) with a business degree in August 1950, just as the Korean 
              | War broke out. Unable to find a job, he became a Fuller Brush salesman working downtown Dallas. He figured that with more women working, the 
              | office towers would be promising new venues for direct sales. So late each afternoon, he'd meet with an office manager or two, leave a brochure 
              | and ask if he could return the next day with free brushes for the staff and an order sheet.
            p
              | "Believe it or not, if you were nice and polite and didn't overstay your welcome, they'd say, "Sure," he recalls. His biggest sellers were 
              | three-for-99-cent toothbrushes; even so, he managed to make a pretty good living.
            p
              | Then he went to work for a company that was remodeling drugstores across the United States. Mr. Potts, who always enjoyed art and graphic 
              | design, wanted his stores to look better than anybody else's. Sohe'd rent a Styrofoam cutter from a local florist to make big letters 
              | for the walls that spelled out cosmetics, sundries, soda fountains, prescriptions, etc.
            p
              | That work led him into retail graphics with The Store Decor in 1983. The retail design firm, which is still located downtown and 
              | continues to design drugstores, college bookstores and hardware stores nationwide, came off without a hitch. Store Decor's success 
              | would take years to achieve.
            p
              | By 1985, Mr. Potts was ready to close the graphics business. Sales slumped to less than $100,000 that year, with two employees 
              | holding on for dear life. Real estate had tanked, and small stores were being eaten alive.
            p
              | "I knew the idea was good, and I believed in it, but you've got to look at things from a business standpoint," he says. "I couldn't 
              | figure out how we were going to make a profit out of this." Fortunately his wife persuaded him to hang on for a while longer. 
              | "A while" turned out to be four years, when along came BizMart, the office-supply superstore chain. "We did 80some-odd stores for 
              | them. Then we found out that's how you make money," he says with a laugh.
            p
              | PetSmart had a store next door to a BizMart in Tucson, and the ball really started rolling, with sales growing at 40 percent 50percent 
              | for the next several years.
            h6 Popular figure
            p
              | For the first time, the company recently completed afiscal year ahead of projections, posting sales of $15 million, up nearly 25percent. 
              | Profits at the privately held company showed similar improvements.
            p
              | On a recent workshop tour, several employees call out to "Mr.P" to say thanks. He responds to the workers by name, asking about daughters in 
              | college, a wife recovering from illness and after-hours schooling.Strolling through paint-spray chambers, wood shavings and foam remnants, Bob 
              | Potts may seem out of context in his pristine navy business suit, but certainly not out of contact.
            p
              | Out of earshot of their boss, employees say Mr. P is the best guy they've worked for. They add, however, that he expects hard work in return. 
              | Those who don't live up to their end of the bargain don't last long.
            h6 Passion of retailing
            p
              | That would go seriously against the grain for Mr.Potts, the grandson and son of grocers in Gatesville, Texas, who figures that his passion 
              | for retailing is an innate thing. Mr. Potts paid cash for new printing equipment. "The Lord's blessed us, "he says. "We don't owe anybody. We 
              | own our property and our inventory. If we need something and can afford it, we buy it."
            p
              | Last year, he almost built a 100,000-square-foot corporate and manufacturing facility under one large roof to replace the storage shed-like 
              | building. "Glad I didn't," he says simply." I would have had to get a little bit in debt, but I've been there, done that, been burned before." 
              | The road to starting his own business wasn't always easy. In fact for three years while he was trying to get his business off the ground, he 
              | augmented his income as a front-door greeter at the original Elliott's Hardware Store on Maple Avenue.
            p
              | The company would also have given up its unique flexibility: When The Store Decor gets a new big account, it builds another building. Lose a 
              | major client, and lease a building out. And in a world where companies outsource just about everything, Mr. Potts believes that his people can 
              | do it better for less.
            p
              | "My good friend Jerry Elliott (of hardware store fame) taught me that whatever there is, there's a better way, and there are young people out 
              | there thinking it up. My job as an older guy is to search it out and bring it home."
